Repository contains the key files for debug build.
The release key files are hidden from public in NetOffice 2.0 and above.

If you want to create a custom release build, you need to create your own key files
and modify the file "NetOffice\Core\KeyTokens_Release.txt"

You can ask for release key files also.
