1.) The tutorials demonstrate most of the new core features.

2.) Skip support for old .Net Runtime versions - minimum is .Net 4.0(Client Profile)
    Want to support .Net 4 as long as possible because it is the last WindowsXP compatible Runtime.
    (NetOffice 1.7.3 with .Net 2/3 support is still available in the download section)

3.) Microsoft Publisher is now into play.

4.) Total size of the assemblies is 25% smaller

5.) New base class for Excel RTD Server

6.) Actual Developer Toolbox is currently not available
    because need to publish this release before codeplex goes into read-only mode

7.) Official repository on github is "netofficefw" - NOT "netoffice"
